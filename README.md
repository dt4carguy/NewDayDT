This repository will contain all of the code and related files and images used to create a mechanism to direct and document the process of me becoming and doing the things I've always wanted to do. Since I was a child, I've wanted to draw, illustrate, design and build things - I've wanted to solve problems. As an adult, I abandoned those dreams so I could make money. I thought I would make enough money to either not care whether or not I became an artist, engineer, architect or computer programmer, or I would be able to do those things at some later time. Well, now I am fifty-two years old and constantly yearning to become the person I've always desired to be, but have spend a lifetime shelving it to make money. Fear. It drives most of the decisions I've made over the past thirty-something years. BUt also, greed and envy. Being envoius of what others have and greedy to make more has played it's part as well. 
Well, today (actually last night), I embark on this journey to become the person I've always wanted to be and thereby becoming the person that can give society what I really have to offer.
This project will also be used to help me understand and utilize git and github, so I can put them to good use in my Python (and other languages) education and thereafter in practice.
